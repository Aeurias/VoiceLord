**So how does it work?**

**VoiceLord** works by using a speech recognition utility [**VoiceMacro**](http://www.voicemacro.net/download/) (*Which is like VoiceAttack but costs you nothing, yes it's free!*) with this we can send a combination of keys to the game to cast our commands for controlling troops = **Less faffing about with your keyboard + more immersion + more action!**


**Give us some examples!**

With **VoiceLord**, you're able to select troops individually, all of them or in groups, and have them do formations, movements & commands.
Saying a command such as *"Infantry and archers, make a shield wall"* will have those troops to make a shield wall for you.


**Can I use sweary words?**

Of course, because swearing is cool... just add the F word to some commands or... just say *"Fookin leg it"* to do a rapid retreat!


**So how do I get setup?**

Simple, you will need:

+ **A microphone.**
+ [**VoiceMacro**](http://www.voicemacro.net/download/)
+ [**My VoiceLord profile**](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/59/)

1. **Download the VoiceLord file from the files section and extract it.**
2. **Import into VoiceMacro by pressing the Edit button at the top left.**
3. **Then on the Profiles and macros window, press Import at the bottom.**
4. **The profile will be loaded, press Save.**
5. **Now on the VoiceMacro window to make sure *Mount and Blade II Bannerlord* is the target or choose *Active Window*.**

You can test to see if voice recognition and/or your microphone is working by saying *"can you hear me?"* a Windows TTS bot will respond, letting you know!

That's all! Now grab a glass a water to keep that voice of yours hydrated and start a battle!

## Help it doesn't work for me!


You will need to set up and train your Microsoft speech recognition for better accuracy if you haven't before. The more you train it or the more you use it, the more it will detect your voice correctly; You can do this directly from VoiceMacro, by clicking the 3 lines, burger menu icon on the top right > Windows speech recogniser. It is suggested you do it at least 3 times.

If your voice is recognised but no actions are being inputted into the game, try running VoiceMacro app in **Administrator mode.**

*Also, make sure nothing in the top right of the VoiceMacro app has been toggled off **(Red X).** *


You will also need to make sure you have *Microsoft Speech Recogniser in English* on your machine, most likely you will.


If it's detecting words, but not words you are saying or it has some uncertainty to it, you can change the recognition settings in the *Recogniser settings* in the settings drop window by following the image guide above.


VoiceMacro is using the microphone that is set as *"Default Device"* in **Window's Audio Recording Settings** if you have attached over one microphone you might have to define which one to use as the default microphone - you also have to make sure the microphone **Input Volume Level** is not **too low, too high or the microphone is muted.** Check VoiceMacro's Main Window left bottom corner for the **green Input Volume Meter** to make sure the Microphone Input is not too low when you speak.

*After talking, make a short pause (about 1 sec) before you speak the next command.*

if you misspoke a command (like *"Archers make me wet"*), don't correct yourself by saying *"err, archers, chaaarrgeeee??"*...
If the recognition engine does not understand your command at the first try, don't change your voice, just wait for a second and repeat and speak clearer, this will help it as it learns your voice.


*Speech Recognition will work way better over time, you can blast battle music in the background on speakers or whisper the commands at night and it will understand it.*

**VoiceLord** works by selecting an AI group then doing an command action

So saying: **"*Archers hold your fucking fire!*"** 

This will select the '*Archers*' (with 2 key) and then press '*Hold Fire*' key (with the F4 key).

We also have prefix, infix & suffix:

**"*[;fucking; okay], [;form a; make a], [;go on; adopt; take on]*"** are ***Prefix***

**"*[;fucking]*"** is also an ***Infix***

**"*[;listen to me]*"** is a ***Suffix***
 
These prefix and suffix are optional but help improve the voice detection a lot when they are used in your sentences.

Such as:

> [;okay] **archers** [;listen to me] 

> [;fucking] **charge**

You say = ***"Okay archers listen to me.", "Fucking charge!"*** 

Saying it like this with the use of prefix and suffix is **best** as it detect your voice almost **100%** of the time!


or you say = ***"Archers", "Charge"***

> **archers**

> **charge**


Saying it like this **without** any prefix or suffix is **bad** and makes it **very difficult** for the engine to detect your voice.

Choices are split with  **;** semicolons, you can say any one of them combined with any **prefix/infix/suffix** that is in **[  ]** square brackets for that voice command.
