**So how does it work?**

VoiceLord works by using a speech recognition utility VoiceMacro (Which is like VoiceAttack but costs you nothing, yes it's free!) with this we can send a combination of keys to the game to cast our commands for controlling troops = Less faffing about with your keyboard + more immersion + more action!


**Give us some examples!**

With VoiceLord, you're able to select troops individually, all of them or in groups, and have them do formations, movements & commands.
Saying a command such as "Infantry and archers, make a shield wall" will have those troops to make a shield wall for you.


**Can I use sweary words?**

Of course, because swearing is cool... just add the F word to some commands or... just say "Fookin leg it" to do a rapid retreat!


**So how do I get setup?**

Simple, you will need:

A microphone.
VoiceMacro
My VoiceLord profile.

+ Download the VoiceLord file from the files section and extract it.
+ Import into VoiceMacro by pressing the Edit button at the top left.
+ Then on the Profiles and macros window, press Import at the bottom.
+ The profile will be loaded, press Save.
+ Now on the VoiceMacro window to make sure Mount and Blade II Bannerlord is the target or choose Active Window.

You can test to see if voice recognition and/or your microphone is working by saying "can you hear me?" a Windows TTS bot will respond, letting you know!

That's all! Now grab a glass a water to keep that voice of yours hydrated and start a battle!

**VoiceLord** works by selecting an AI group then doing an command action

So saying: **"*Archers hold your fucking fire!*"** 

This will select the '*Archers*' (with 2 key) and then press '*Hold Fire*' key (with the F4 key).

We also have prefix, infix & suffix:

**"*[;fucking; okay], [;form a; make a], [;go on; adopt; take on]*"** are ***Prefix***

**"*[;fucking]*"** is also an ***Infix***

**"*[;listen to me]*"** is a ***Suffix***
 
These prefix and suffix are optional but help improve the voice detection a lot when they are used in your sentences.

Such as:

> [;okay] **archers** [;listen to me] 

> [;fucking] **charge**

You say = ***"Okay archers listen to me.", "Fucking charge!"*** 

Saying it like this with the use of prefix and suffix is **best** as it detect your voice almost **100%** of the time!


or you say = ***"Archers", "Charge"***

> **archers**

> **charge**


Saying it like this **without** any prefix or suffix is **bad** and makes it **very difficult** for the engine to detect your voice.

Choices are split with  **;** semicolons, you can say any one of them combined with any **prefix/infix/suffix** that is in **[  ]** square brackets for that voice command.
