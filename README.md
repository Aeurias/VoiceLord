**VoiceLord** works by selecting an AI group then doing an command action

So saying: **"*Archers hold your fucking fire!*"** 

This will select the '*Archers*' (with 2 key) and then press '*Hold Fire*' key (with the F4 key).

We also have prefix, infix & suffix:

**"*[;fucking; okay], [;form a; make a], [;go on; adopt; take on]*"** are ***Prefix***

**"*[;fucking]*"** is also an ***Infix***

**"*[;listen to me]*"** is a ***Suffix***
 
These prefix and suffix are optional but help improve the voice detection a lot when they are used in your sentences.

Such as:

> [;okay] **archers** [;listen to me] 

> [;fucking] **charge**

You say = ***"Okay archers listen to me.", "Fucking charge!"*** 

Saying it like this with the use of prefix and suffix is **best** as it detect your voice almost **100%** of the time!


or you say = ***"Archers", "Charge"***

> **archers**

> **charge**


Saying it like this **without** any prefix or suffix is **bad** and makes it **very difficult** for the engine to detect your voice.

Choices are split with  **;** semicolons, you can say any one of them combined with any **prefix/infix/suffix** that is in **[  ]** square brackets for that voice command.
